 1. clone the repository.
 2. open the frontend and backend in separate windows in your editor(like VSCode).
 3. install the required dependencies by running 'npm install' in both workspace.
 4. For backend hosting, I have used 'heroku'.To know how to deploy your API.(https://id.heroku.com/) create app and follow instructions.
 5. For frontend static hosting, I have used firebase. To know how to deploy click here (https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart)
 6. You have to change the required environment variables in '.env.production' in frontend.
 9. for DATABASE add your credentials on Heroku or in 'nodemon.json' if hosting locally.
